 * DECISION: the design doc's ASCII diagram leaves three things ambiguous.
 * Resolved deliberately restrictive here — an absent transition surfaces as a
 * caught error, whereas an invented one is an unenforced rule.
 *
 * 1. `cancelled` is reachable only pre-send (draft, ready, queued). After a
 *    send the outlet is holding the submission, so the exit is the withdrawal
 *    path (section 6.2's expiry workflow), never a silent cancel.
 * 2. No backwards edges. In particular `ready -> draft` (de-ready a package
 *    after a curation edit) is deliberately excluded until Phase 1 defines
 *    package editing; add it there with its own tests.
 * 3. `expired -> declined` is excluded. An outlet that never answered has not
 *    declined; the record stays honest and routes through withdrawal.
